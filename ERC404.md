## What is ERC-404?

â†’ ERC-404 is described as an experimental token standard that combines the characteristics of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. 

â†’ This hybrid approach allows for the creation of tokens that possess both fungible and unique, non-fungible properties. 

â†’ The standard aims to facilitate native liquidity and fractionalization of assets, addressing some of the limitations present in traditional token designs.

## The Mechanics of Pandora

â†’ Pandora operates on the ERC404 standard and introduces a novel mechanism where the purchase of a PANDORA token on 
@Uniswap
 also grants the buyer a corresponding NFT. 

â†’ This NFT is randomly generated and can vary in rarity. If the token is later sold, the associated NFT is burnt, creating a dynamic interplay between the fungible and non-fungible aspects of the token.

â†’ The project has introduced a unique concept where the value and rarity of the NFTs can influence trading strategies. 

â†’ For instance, traders might engage in arbitrage based on the rarity of the NFTs obtained through purchasing PANDORA tokens, potentially selling rare NFTs at a premium.

## The Burn, Mint and In-Between

â†’ If you buy 1 PANDORA on Uniswap, when you confirm the transaction, you'll give away your $ETH and get 1 PANDORA token plus 1 Pandora NFT.

â†’ The NFT you receive is randomly generated, just like regular NFTs. 

â†’ Pandora NFTs are available in various levels of rarity.

ðŸŸ©Green boxes: +/- 39.45%
ðŸŸ¦Blue boxes: +/- 23.44%
ðŸŸªPurple boxes: +/- 19.53%
ðŸŸ§ Orange boxes: +/- 11.72%
ðŸŸ¥Red boxes: +/- 5.86%

â†’ If you want to sell your 1 PANDORA token, you can resell it on Uniswap, but your NFT will be destroyed in the process.

â†’ Transferring NFTs to a new wallet won't affect the NFT. Only transferring the token will result in burning the old NFT and generating a new one.

â†’ You can sell your PANDORA tokens on 
@Uniswap
  or sell your Pandora NFTs on 
@opensea
  and 
@blur_io
.

## Wrap-Up

â†’ The development of ERC404 and the Pandora project represents a bold experiment in the blockchain space, challenging conventional notions of token design and utility. 

â†’ While the project is still in its early stages and carries inherent risks, its ability to inspire collaboration, innovation, and exploration within the DeFi community is undeniable.

â†’ With the success of Pandora, we may expect to see other projects based on ERC-404 emerging soon.
